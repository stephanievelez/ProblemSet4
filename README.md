This game assimilates the game of Scrable
A person can request a new hand to be dealt from random letters and then try to come up with a word that can score the highest points
This program allows the user to keep track of his/her score and reuse the last hand to see if he/she can beat his/her previous score
The score is based on the Scrable scoring system where the most used letters such as 'a' are scored 1 point and the least used letters are scored higher points (ie "x" = 8 point)
